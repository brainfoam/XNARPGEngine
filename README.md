# XNARPGEngine
This is an old project (2016) that is written pretty horribly! Feel free to dissect it as you'd like, but I'm not updating this anymore. There's some "nice" code under the text and character managers, but overall this project just helped me learn how *not* to sort out a modular engine for RPGs.

This project has moved on to a new engine, made in GML under a new name, "Hikko."
